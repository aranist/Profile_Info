# Profile
Describes myself and the projects I have worked on.

### Background
I was born and raised in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the land of enchantment, and lived a happy life skiing, riding bikes, and hiking with my family and playing soccer after school. I went to highschool in Colorado, and fell in love with biological sciences and literature. I attended the University of California, Santa Cruz, and recieved a Bachelors Degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and a minor in Computer Science. Currently I am seeking a job at the intersection of data science and GIS, or GIS and Policy.
